- All you need to do is just type keyboard shortcut(`⌥`(Alt)+`⇧`+`c`) or omnibar/slash command named `Run JS`
- It can turn current code block into js evaluation mode.
- It can generate a blank RunJS code block if the caret is within a blank line.
- It can revert all the evaluation mode if it is within a RunJS code block, but you can also regenerate the evaluation mode in a blank line.
